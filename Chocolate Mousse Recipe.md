Inspiration: https://bromabakery.com/easy-chocolate-mousse/

#### Ingredients
1. 1 egg, room temperature (I have never used room temperature)
2. 8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, equivalent to about 1/2 cup
3. 1 tsp espresso powder
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 2 tsp vanilla extract
6. 2/3 cup + 1/2 cup heavy cream
7. pinch of sea sal

#### Steps
1. (Add) Place ***8 ounces*** (semi-sweet) finely chopped chocolate, ***1 tsp*** espresso powder, and ***1 room temperature egg*** in a high-power blender.
2. (Boil) In a saucepan (or kettle), heat ***1/4 cup*** of water until boiling. 
3. (Blend) Pour boiling water into the chocolate and ***blend on high speed until smooth***.
4. (Warm, Experiment) Heat ***2/3 cup of heavy cream*** until very warm. Personal experience, ***microwave on high for 25-30 seconds***. DO NOT BOIL.
5. Stream the cream into the chocolate mixture as you blend. OR, just slowly add, and then blend.
6. Add ***2 tbsps*** of vanilla extract and a pinch of salt.
7. Blend on high speed for 1 min.
**8. (CHECKPOINT) The mixture should be creamy and smooth with no pieces of chocolate remaining.**
9. In a separate bowl, ***whisk the last 1/2 cup of cold heavy whipping cream*** until soft peaks form. I personally have only seen soft peaks once.
10. Pour the chocolate mixture into the whipped cream and gently fold until completely combined and no pockets of whipped cream remain.
11. Spoon into ***4 cups*** (the ones I have).
12. Refrigerate for ***>= 4 hours***.
